Takes around 1.5 hrs to fully recharge\r\n\r\nSo.. fully deserved 5 Rating.

Till now (i.e. 10th Sep 13), Flipkart has not converted this into EMI despite four email and three calls !!! \r\nFew questions that Flipkart has still not answered till now...\r\n\r\n0) Why it takes 25 days to convert to EMI? (As per Flipkart this is max 7 days process)\r\n1) What if my credit card is charged with full amount? Will Flipkart pay full amount on my behalf?\r\n2) Why my emails were not responded on time? Why my call back request is not honoured?\r\n3) Why did Flipkart repeatedly missed the promised response time every time?\r\n\r\nThis product was offered as part of freedom offer, I remember correctly that there was 2000/- cashback. What I got is Rs. 1000/-. When I raised this, once again flipkart took 2 weeks and maintained that it was Rs. 1000/-. The cashback offer amount was not mentionted in the invoice. Flipkart is not being transparent.\r\n\r\nPlease do something better and meaningful other than apologizing every time and taking your own sweet time to respond.\r\n\r\nEMI CONVERSION HAPPENED FINALLY AFTER 8 Emails, 6 phone calls and strongly worded message on FACEBOOK and TWITTER and reminding flipkart about 4 yr long relationship, 240 purchases worth 1.4 lac over last 2 yrs..

So I waited patiently.\r\n\r\nDoes it mean D5100 is inferior - the answer is \"NO\" but just that it has a more experienced and better equipped elder brother who has joined the family.\r\n\r\nBoth the cameras have common strengths and weaknesses. To mention a few -\r\n\r\nSTRENGTHS - Low noise (grain) at high ISO's / good image quality and colour depth / flip out screens / focus continuously while recording movies / in-camera HDR (high dynamic range)\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES - No focus motor / slow max shutter speed (1/4000 of a second ) / no image stabilization / no panorama mode / slow continuous shooting ( 5fps on D5200 vs 4fps on D5100 )\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCES - D5100 is a good 10k less than D5200 with the 18-55mm kit lens / longer battery life in D5100\r\n\r\nSo why should one buy a D5200???\r\n\r\n1. Many more focus points - 39 vs 11\r\n2. Much higher resolution - 24MP vs 16.1MP\r\n3. More cross-type focus points - 9 vs 1\r\n4. Shoots faster - 5fps vs 4fps\r\n5. In-built audio - Stereo vs Mono\r\n\r\nD5100 was launched in April 2011 \r\n\r\nI have not had a proper opportunity to put my camera through the grid but the few shots taken are simply amazing. I will probably write another review later.\r\n\r\nI am a complete amateur so far as photography goes but learning everyday.\r\n\r\nHope the above helps...\r\n", "date" : { "$date" : 1389772020922 }, "himId" : "anh123", "userName" : "Naman Jain", "important" : false, "likeCounts" : 0, "dislikeCount" : 0, "ownerId" : "52d4e5a80de96522998ec486", "ownerType" : "com.anh.him.gdb.domain.live.GMultipleAddressLiveService", "attachments" : [] }

Ergonomics wise I feel very good in my hands. \r\nThey have upgraded to 9 cross type auto focus points compared to 1 in previous one.\r\nVideo quality has been improved and in manual mode one can control ISO and shutter speed with ease. \r\nNew feature of using it with WR-R10 will be a plus point to those who want wireless. \r\nMegapixel has been upgraded from 16mp to 24mp though I am not a pixel peeper..\r\n\r\nIn nut and shell I can say that it has stolen most of the qualities of D7000 that includes 39 autofocus. Ofcource at this price no company would give you a metal body with prosumer grade dslr qualities . \r\n\r\nOne good thing is that it has a fantastic metering and has no over exposure and back focus problem like D7000.

Even a 8MP Camera is sufficient for 13 X 19\" prints.... there is not almost any difference between a 12 MP and 20 MP sensor ( invisible difference )... Besides this in Point And Shoot cameras generally, a higher pixel count produces more noise... And, after using both Sony CB DSC-HX300 and HX200, I must adore that the picture quality of the latter is better (Though it is 18.2 MP ).\r\n\r\n2) Please read the specifications attentively... 921,600 dots is the resolution of the LCD of the camera, not of image.\r\n\r\n3) The ISO 12800 and 6400 are just crap... In this camera noise appears even on ISO-400.... And, on ISO-1600 many details are lost... And, in this field Canon SX50 HS excels... With its DIGIC 5 processor it handles noise excellently... \r\n\r\n4) From my personal experience ( I am a user of Nikon D3100 ) I can say that you have no need of 1/4000 sec shutter speed.... Even for water drop photography 1/2000 sec is sufficient... Though you will need that if you want to photograph a bullet !!!!!!\r\n\r\n......... At last, buy a DSLR, why you will you pay 25000 for a point and shoot camera with a 1/2.3 inch sensor !!!!!", "date" : { "$date" : 1389775441658 }, "himId" : "anh123", "userName" : "Naman Jain", "important" : false, "likeCounts" : 0, "dislikeCount" : 0, "ownerId" : "52d546010de9893221b154ec", "ownerType" : "com.anh.him.gdb.domain.live.GMultipleAddressLiveService", "attachments" : [] }
